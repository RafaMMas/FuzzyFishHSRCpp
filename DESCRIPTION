Description: FuzzyFishHSRCpp provides functions to develop and inspect zero-order presence-absence Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy rule-based systems for fish habitat evaluation within environmental flow assessemnt studies. The main difference with the former packages relies in the function to carry out predictions, which has been reprogremmed in C++.

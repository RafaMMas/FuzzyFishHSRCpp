Weighted.mean.optimisation(
  Observed.output,
  data,
  FRBS,

}
\arguments{
\item{Observed.output}{A numeric vector of observed output values (target variable).}

\item{data}{A data frame or matrix of input variables (predictors) used for evaluating membership.}

\item{FRBS}{A list representing the fuzzy rule-based system, where \code{FRBS[[1]]} contains membership functions
and \code{FRBS[[3]]} contains input variable limits.}

\item{case.weights}{Optional numeric vector of weights for each training instance. If \code{NULL}, equal weights are used.}

\item{Max.value}{Optional numeric value to assign to the rule with the highest consequent.}

\item{Min.value}{Optional numeric value to assign to the rule with the lowest consequent.}

\item{Rescale.to}{Optional numeric vector of length 2 indicating the range to rescale the consequents to (e.g., \code{c(0, 1)}).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of optimized rule consequents, one for each fuzzy rule.
}
\description{
Optimizes the rule consequents of a Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy rule-based system (FRBS)
using a weighted mean approach. Each consequent is calculated as the weighted mean of
the observed outputs, weighted by the membership degree of each data point to the corresponding rule.
}
\details{
The function uses \code{evaluateFIS_cpp()} to compute membership values of each instance for all fuzzy rules.
Then, it computes the weighted mean of the observed outputs per rule, using membership degrees (and optional case weights)
as weights. Optionally, the consequents can be rescaled and/or clipped using \code{Max.value} and \code{Min.value}.

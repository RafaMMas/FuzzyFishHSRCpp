\title{Print Fuzzy Rules from a Fuzzy Rule-Based System}
\usage{
Print.rules(FRBS)
}
\arguments{
\item{FRBS}{A list representing the fuzzy rule-based system, typically containing:
\describe{
\item{[\link{1}]}{A named list of membership functions for each input variable.}
\item{\code{$ruleConsequents}}{A vector of consequents associated with the fuzzy rules.}
}}
}
\value{
Prints a data frame with fuzzy input combinations and rule consequents. Returns \code{NULL} invisibly.
}
\description{
This function prints the rule base of a fuzzy rule-based system (FRBS), associating fuzzy input labels with corresponding consequents.
}
\details{
The function generates human-readable fuzzy labels (e.g., "Low", "Medium", "High") based on the number of fuzzy sets per input variable (up to a maximum of 5 sets).
It then prints a data frame showing all combinations of these fuzzy input labels along with their associated rule consequents.

Supported fuzzy set label mappings:
\itemize{
\item 2 sets: "Low", "High"
\item 3 sets: "Low", "Medium", "High"
\item 4 sets: "Very low", "Low", "High", "Very high"
\item 5 sets: "Very low", "Low", "Medium", "High", "Very high"
}

If any input variable has more than 5 fuzzy sets, the function will stop with an error.

\title{Evaluate Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) Using C++}
\usage{
evaluateFIS_cpp(
  inputData,
  membershipFunctions,
  ruleConsequents,
  inputLimits = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputData}{A numeric matrix where each row represents an input vector to be evaluated.}

\item{membershipFunctions}{A list of membership functions defining the fuzzy sets for the input variables.}

\item{ruleConsequents}{A list of fuzzy rule consequents that determine the system's output based on the applied rules.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix where the first column contains the computed output values, and the remaining columns indicate the degree of membership to each fuzzy rule.
}
\description{
This function evaluates a fuzzy inference system (FIS) using C++ for improved computational efficiency.
It processes input data through specified membership functions and rule consequents, applying fuzzy logic to compute outputs.
}
\details{
The function utilizes fuzzy logic to evaluate input data against predefined membership functions and rule consequents.
The output includes both the computed fuzzy output and rule memberships, aiding interpretability in fuzzy inference systems.

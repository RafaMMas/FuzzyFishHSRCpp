\title{Perform Sensitivity Analysis on Fuzzy Rule-Based System}
\usage{
Sensitivity.analysis(FRBS, data, Selected.variable = NULL, n.pt = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{FRBS}{A list representing the fuzzy rule-based system. It should contain three elements:
\describe{
\item{[\link{1}]}{Membership functions}
\item{[\link{2}]}{Rule consequents}
\item{[\link{3}]}{Input limits}
}}

\item{data}{A data frame of input data to the model.}

\item{Selected.variable}{A character vector of variable names to include in the sensitivity analysis. If \code{NULL}, all variables in \code{data} are used.}

\item{n.pt}{An integer specifying the number of points over which to evaluate the sensitivity for each variable. Defaults to 20.}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames, each corresponding to a variable in \code{Selected.variable}. Each data frame includes:
\describe{
\item{x.pt}{Values over which the variable was varied}
\item{mean.Suitability}{Mean predicted output for each value}
\item{0 to 1 (quantiles)}{Quantiles (0\% to 100\%) of predicted outputs}
}
}
\description{
This function performs a sensitivity analysis on a fuzzy rule-based system (FRBS) by varying selected input variables over a specified range and computing the resulting model outputs.
}
\details{
For each selected variable, the function varies its value across a range (min to max) while holding other variables constant, and evaluates the FRBS model at each point. It then calculates the mean and quantiles of the predicted outputs.

\examples{
\dontrun{
result <- Sensitivity.analysis(FRBS, input_data)
plot(result[["Variable1"]][,1], result[["Variable1"]][,"mean.Suitability"])
}
